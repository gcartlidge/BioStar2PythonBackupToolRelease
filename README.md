# I thought of doing a public rep for the .exe so its easier!<br>

Running BackupRestore.exe will instantly get the backup server running, this uses:<br>
Default port of 449<br>
Default IP of 127.0.0.1<br>
Default cert file locations of BioStar 2(x64)<br><br>
If any of these need changing, simply edit run.conf after first run.
<br><br>
The download link for the backup will only work if site is secure (Or changed chrome settings)
<br>
Install the certificate properly first!
<br><br>
The tool by default is setup for 64 bit usage, but the folders used for backup can be changed within the settings section
<br>
The mysqldump.exe and mysql.exe instances can also be changed but use the default ones in the BioStar2 (x64) folder.

Its still rough, but any ideas, shoot me an email at gcartlidge@supremainc.com :)
